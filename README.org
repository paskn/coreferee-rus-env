To install the version of [[https://github.com/richardpaulhudson/coreferee][coreferee]] library with support for Russian,
follow steps outlined in =install_coreferee_ru.sh=.

The environment is managed by =uv=. To install =uv= follow the
[[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/][official instructions]] or uncomment the first line in
=install_coreferee_ru.sh= to try installing =uv= with =wget=.

Here is what will happen:

1. You will recreate a =.venv= in this repository and activate it;
2. You will clone [[https://github.com/posavinova/coreferee/tree/dd238ff15cb049059fa1b0b02e740eacf6301bc1][a specific fork]] of =coreferee= into the parent
   directory (relative to this directory);
3. You will switch into the cloned version of the library and install
   support for Russian.

Hopefully, all this will become unnecessary when [[https://github.com/richardpaulhudson/coreferee/pull/33][this PR]] is accepted.
